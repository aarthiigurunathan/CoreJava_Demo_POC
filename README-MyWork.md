# CoreJava_Demo_POC
Given Requirement :
1.	Create the table and data using the schema.txt file.
2.	Write a java program to read the input.txt file and read the data.
3.	For department name find the corresponding department id and replace it.
4.	Based on the data perform the insert or update operation.
5.	Read the deletestudent.txt and delete the student data from the table.
6.	There are three types output files needs to be generated.

b.	Student table data with department data. Please refer Output_student_table.txt

c.	Student table data with department filtered by “EEE”. Output_depertmentwiseStudentReport.txt

Given data : ( As files )
1.	Schema 
2.	Input
3.	Data need to be performed in CRUD operations

Work done by me :

•	Created Table according to schema and read the input.txt

•	Mapped and Replaced DepartmentID with Department and updated table

•	Also, Read the deletestudent.txt and deleted the student data from the table.

•	Generated Department wise Student report, Student table data

Yet To Do :

•	Department wise report yet to perform.

Learning From Sprint 1 ( Core Java – JDBC ) :
